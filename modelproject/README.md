# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **ModelProject**. We examine the time-varying co-movements and portfolio diversification between Danish and German stock markets employing the symmetric conditional correlation multivariate GARCH models and following the minimum variance portfolio approach. We use daily return data for C20 and DAX30 indices for the period 2000 to 2021. This study finds a useful combination of Danish and German stock markets for construction of a portfolio in order to minimize the risk.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
